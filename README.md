# Deriving and Communicating Insights with Data Visualization
Exploratory and explanatory data analysis of [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/) loan data with Python in Jupyter Notebook for demonstrating the significance of data visualization techniques in data analysis. Data visualizations are created with libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn throughout the course of the data analysis process from systematically exploring the dataset to deriving meaningful insights and communicating key findings.

## Software Requirements
* conda 4.6.3 or similar versions
* python 3.7.2 (or python 3)
* Libraries
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## Datasets
* `data/` Directory
  - This directory contains the raw dataset and its data dictionary.
  - Sources of the files available in this directory are described below instead of uploading these files to the remote repository.
* `prosperLoanData.csv`
  - Prosper loan data was made available by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) for students enrolled in its __Data Analyst Nanodegree__ program.
  - The data was manually downloaded from this [link](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv).
* `data_dictionary.xlsx`
  - The Excel file lists the names of all variables in the loan data and provides the definition for each variable.
  - The file was manually downloaded from the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0).
